## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

This will be a website where you can discover an event that fits you. 

The project will be designed using the 5 planes of UX design. I will ofcourse be taking a mobile-first approach. This is especially important for an events based website, as usersare more likely to be travelling while using it.

#### User stories

<!-- Turn this into a table -->
1	User	I want to see events 	Find one I like and buy a ticket
2	User	I want to see event details	Make an informed decision before buying a ticket
3	User 	I want to sign up for an account	To buy tickets
4	Staff member	I want confirmation of work at an event	Revisit event details and confirm im booked
5	Venue manager	I want to list my venue	I can book events
6	Venue manager	I want to list events for my venue	I can sell tickets
7	Venue manager	I want to see how many people are signed up	To know how many people are coming
8	Venue manager	I want to edit my venue and event details	To keep them up-to-date

### Stragtegy Plane

Bright Times will be an event directory where users can find events and pay for tickets.
